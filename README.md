            <h5>Locker Combinations and Schedules</h4>
            </p>For all grade levels make sure you write down your combination to your gym and regular locker somewhere safe. Especially in the beginning of the year, that way you always have it incase you need it. If you are in sixth grade, it may seem hard to remember two very important things, but it gets easier. Say the combo out loud, it helps you remember it easier. Or you could write it on your wrists with marker. But make sure not to get too attached to your combinations, because if your school is anything liek mine, then you will get a new combination each year. Seventh and eigth graders might be able to tell you if that statement is true. Seventh and eigth graders, those trips aren't just for the sixth garders! You can use them as well. <br> <br> All three years of middle school, I have written my combo on something I always have everyday. My shoes! Now, you are probably thinking "does she really bring the same pair of shoes everywhere?," and the answer is yes. Yes I do. I wear the same pair of shoes everyday and I'll tell you why in the "Gym Class" section. So go there after reading this for more information.<br> <br> Nextly, never share your combinations with ANYONE! Not even your family. You never know what will happen if you share the combos with someone. Just keep it to yourself. <br> <br> Schedules! Let's move onto talking about your schedule. </p>
